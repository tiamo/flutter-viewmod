# Flutter VM (ViewModel)

A very simple flutter plugin that implements the `MVVM` pattern.

Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation 
of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) – be it via a markup language or 
GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) 
so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform.
